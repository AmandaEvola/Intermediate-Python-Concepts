# List comprehension to generate squares of numbers from 0 to 9

squares = [x ** 2 for x in range (10)]

print(squares) #Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

# Generating squares refers to calculating the square of each number in a sequence or range. In mathematics, the square of a number is the result of multiplying the number by itself.

# For example:

# The square of 2 is 4 because 2 × 2 = 4

# The square of 3 is 9 because 3 × 3 = 9

# The square of 4 is 16 because 4 × 4 = 16

# When we talk about generating squares, we mean computing the square of each number in a given sequence or range and collecting the results.

# In the context of programming, such as with Python list comprehensions, generating squares typically involves iterating over a sequence of numbers and applying an operation to calculate the square of each number. This operation results in a list of squares where each element represents the square of the corresponding number in the original sequence.
